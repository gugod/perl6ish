=head1 NAME

Perl6ish - Some Perl6 programming in Perl5 code.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Perl6ish;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl6ish allows you to write Perl5 code some Perl6 look-n-feel. It
uses many good evil techniques to extend Perl5 syntax. Many of which
has been already done in the C<Perl6::*> namespace, some of them are
coded only in the Perl6ish distrition.

When you say C<use Perl6ish> in your code, it's exactualy the same
as saying this:

    use Perl6::Perl 'perl';
    use Perl6::Slurp;
    use Perl6::Caller;
    use Perl6::Take;
    use Perl6::Say;
    use Perl6::Contexts;
    use Perl6::Junction qw/all any one none/;
    use Perl6ish::Syntax::temp;
    use Perl6ish::Syntax::state;
    use Perl6ish::Syntax::constant;
    use Perl6ish::Array;
    use Perl6ish::Hash;
    use Perl6ish::String;
    use Perl6ish::Syntax::DotMethod;

C<Perl6ish::Syntax::*> modules are syntax extensions. Variable
declarators, C<temp>, C<state> and C<constant>, are implemented under
this namespace. They can be used alone if you prefer not to load all
those moduels above all at once.
